  Ardour And Memory By Dante Gabriel Rossetti from Change And Fate, The House of Life

  The cuckoo-throb, the heartbeat of the Spring;
   The rosebud's blush that leaves it as it grows
  Into the full-eyed fair unblushing rose;
   The summer clouds that visit every wing
  With fires of sunrise and of sunsetting;
   The furtive flickering streams to light re-born
  'Mid airs new-fledged and valorous lusts of morn,
   While all the daughters of the daybreak sing:--

  These ardour loves, and memory: and when flown
   All joys, and through dark forest-boughs in flight
  The wind swoops onward brandishing the light,
   Even yet the rose-tree's verdure left alone
  Will flush all ruddy though the rose be gone;
   With ditties and with dirges infinite.
