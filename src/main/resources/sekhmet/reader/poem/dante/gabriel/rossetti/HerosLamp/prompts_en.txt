  Hero's Lamp By Dante Gabriel Rossetti from Change And Fate, The House of Life

  That lamp thou fill'st in Eros name to-night,
   O Hero, shall the Sestian augurs take
  Tomorrow, and for drowned Leander's sake
   To Anteros its fireless lip shall plight.
  Aye, waft the unspoken vow: yet dawn's first light
   On ebbing storm and life twice ebb'd must break;
  While 'neath no sunrise, by the Avernian Lake,
   Lo where Love walks, Death's pallid neophyte.

  That lamp within Anteros' shadowy shrine
   Shall stand unlit (for so the gods decree)
  Till some one man the happy issue see
   Of a life's love, and bid its flame to shine:
  Which still may rest unfir'd; for, theirs or thine,
   O brother, what brought love to them or thee?
