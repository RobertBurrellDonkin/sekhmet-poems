  Lost Days By Dante Gabriel Rossetti from Change And Fate, The House of Life

  The lost days of my life until to-day,
   What were they, could I see them on the street
  Lie as they fell? Would they be ears of wheat
   Sown once for food but trodden into clay?
  Or golden coins squandered and still to pay?
   Or drops of blood dabbling the guilty feet?
  Or such spilt water as in dreams must cheat
   The throats of men in Hell, who thirst alway?

  I do not see them here; but after death
   God knows I know the faces I shall see,
  Each one a murdered self, with low last breath.
   'I am thyself,--what hast thou done to me?'
  'And I--and I--thyself,' (lo! each one saith,)
   'And thou thyself to all eternity!'
