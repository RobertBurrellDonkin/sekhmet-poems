  Venus Victrix By Dante Gabriel Rossetti from Youth And Change, The House of Life

  Could Juno's self more sovereign presence wear
   Than thou, 'mid other ladies throned in grace?--
  Or Pallas, when thou bend'st with soul-stilled face
   O'er poet's page gold-shadowed in thy hair?
  Dost thou than Venus seem less heavenly fair
   When o'er the sea of love's tumultuous trance
  Hovers thy smile, and mingles with thy glance
   That sweet voice like the last wave murmuring there?

  Before such triune loveliness divine
   Awestruck I ask, which goddess here most claims
  The prize that, howsoe'er adjudged, is thine?
   Then Love breathes low the sweetest of thy names;
  And Venus Victrix to my heart doth bring
   Herself, the Helen of her guerdoning.
