  Love Enthroned By Dante Gabriel Rossetti from Youth And Change, The House of Life

  I marked all kindred Powers the heart finds fair:--
   Truth, with awed lips; and Hope, with eyes upcast;
  And Fame, whose loud wings fan the ashen Past
   To signal-fires, Oblivion's flight to scare;
  And Youth, with still some single golden hair
   Unto his shoulder clinging, since the last
  Embrace wherein two sweet arms held him fast;
   And Life, still wreathing flowers for Death to wear.

  Love's throne was not with these; but far above
   All passionate wind of welcome and farewell
  He sat in breathless bowers they dream not of;
   Though Truth foreknow Love's heart, and Hope foretell,
  And Fame be for Love's sake desirable,
   And Youth be dear, and Life be sweet to Love.
