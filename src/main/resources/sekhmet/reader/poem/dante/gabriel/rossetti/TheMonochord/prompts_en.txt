  The Monochord By Dante Gabriel Rossetti from Change And Fate, The House of Life

  Is it this sky's vast vault or ocean's sound
   That is Life's self and draws my life from me,
  And by instinct ineffable decree
   Holds my breath quailing on the bitter bound?
  Nay, is it Life or Death, thus thunder-crown'd,
   That 'mid the tide of all emergency
  Now notes my separate wave, and to what sea
   Its difficult eddies labour in the ground?

  Oh! what is this that knows the road I came,
   The flame turned cloud, the cloud returned to flame,
  The lifted shifted steeps and all the way?--
   That draws round me at last this wind-warm space,
  And in regenerate rapture turns my face
   Upon the devious coverts of dismay?
