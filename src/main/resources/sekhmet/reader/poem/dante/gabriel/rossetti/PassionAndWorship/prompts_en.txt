  Passion And Worship By Dante Gabriel Rossetti from Youth And Change, The House of Life

  One flame-winged brought a white-winged harp-player
   Even where my lady and I lay all alone;
  Saying: 'Behold, this minstrel is unknown;
   Bid him depart, for I am minstrel here:
  Only my strains are to Love's dear ones, dear.'
   Then said I: 'Through thine hautboy's rapturous tone
  Unto my lady still this harp makes moan,
   And still she deems the cadence deep and clear.'

  Then said my lady: 'Thou art Passion of Love,
   And this Love's Worship: both he plights to me.
  Thy mastering music walks the sunlit sea:
   But where wan water trembles in the grove
  And the wan moon is all the light thereof,
   This harp still makes my name its voluntary.'
