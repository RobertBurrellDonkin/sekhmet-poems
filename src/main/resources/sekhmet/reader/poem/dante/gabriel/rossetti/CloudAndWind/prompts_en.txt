  Cloud And Wind By Dante Gabriel Rossetti from Youth And Change, The House of Life

  Love, should I fear death most for you or me?
   Yet if you die, can I not follow you,
  Forcing the straits of change? Alas! but who
   Shall wrest a bond from night's inveteracy,
  Ere yet my hazardous soul put forth, to be
   Her warrant against all her haste might rue?--
  Ah! in your eyes so reached what dumb adieu,
   What unsunned gyres of waste eternity?

  And if I die the first, shall death be then
   A lampless watchtower whence I see you weep?--
  Or (woe is me!) a bed wherein my sleep
   Ne'er notes (as death's dear cup at last you drain),
  The hour when you too learn that all is vain
   And that Hope sows what Love shall never reap?
