  The Birth Bond By Dante Gabriel Rossetti from Youth And Change, The House of Life

  Have you not noted, in some family
   Where two were born of a first marriage-bed,
  How still they own their gracious bond, though fed
   And nursed on the forgotten breast and knee?--
  How to their father's children they shall be
   In act and thought of one goodwill; but each
  Shall for the other have, in silence speech,
   And in a word complete community?

  Even so, when first I saw you, seemed it, love,
   That among souls allied to mine was yet
  One nearer kindred than life hinted of.
   O born with me somewhere that men forget,
  And though in years of sight and sound unmet,
   Known for my soul's birth-partner well enough!
