  The Sun's Shame By Dante Gabriel Rossetti from Change And Fate, The House of Life

  Beholding youth and hope in mockery caught
   From life; and mocking pulses that remain
  When the soul's death of bodily death is fain;
   Honour unknown, and honour known unsought;
  And penury's sedulous self-torturing thought
   On gold, whose master therewith buys his bane;
  And longed-for woman longing all in vain
   For lonely man with love's desire distraught;
  And wealth, and strength, and power, and pleasantness,
   Given unto bodies of whose souls men say,
  None poor and weak, slavish and foul, as they:--
   Beholding these things, I behold no less
  The blushing morn and blushing eve confess
   The shame that loads the intolerable day.

  As some true chief of men, bowed down with stress
   Of life's disastrous eld, on blossoming youth
  May gaze, and murmur with self-pity and ruth,
   'Might I thy fruitless treasure but possess,
  Such blessing of mine all coming years should bless;'--
   Then sends one sigh forth to the unknown goal,
  And bitterly feels breathe against his soul
   The hour swift-winged of nearer nothingness:--

  Even so the World's grey Soul to the green World
   Perchance one hour must cry: 'Woe's me, for whom
  Inveteracy of ill portends the doom,--
   Whose heart's old fire in shadow of shame is furl'd:
  While thou even as of yore art journeying,
   All soulless now, yet merry with the Spring!'
