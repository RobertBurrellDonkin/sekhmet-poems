  Hoarded Joy By Dante Gabriel Rossetti from Change And Fate, The House of Life

  I said: 'Nay, pluck not,--let the first fruit be:
   Even as thou sayest, it is sweet and red,
  But let it ripen still. The tree's bent head
   Sees in the stream its own fecundity
  And bides the day of fulness. Shall not we
   At the sun's hour that day possess the shade,
  And claim our fruit before its ripeness fade,
   And eat it from the branch and praise the tree?'

  I say: 'Alas! our fruit hath wooed the sun
   Too long,--'tis fallen and floats adown the stream.
  Lo, the last clusters! Pluck them every one,
   And let us sup with summer; ere the gleam
  Of autumn set the year's pent sorrow free,
   And the woods wail like echoes from the sea.'
