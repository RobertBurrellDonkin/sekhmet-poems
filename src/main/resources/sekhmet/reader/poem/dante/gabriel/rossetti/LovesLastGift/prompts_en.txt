  Love's Last Gift By Dante Gabriel Rossetti from Youth And Change, The House of Life

  Love to his singer held a glistening leaf,
   And said: 'The rose-tree and the apple-tree
  Have fruits to vaunt or flowers to lure the bee;
   And golden shafts are in the feathered sheaf
  Of the great harvest-marshal, the year's chief,
   Victorious Summer; aye, and 'neath warm sea
  Strange secret grasses lurk inviolably
   Between the filtering channels of sunk reef.

  All are my blooms; and all sweet blooms of love
   To thee I gave while Spring and Summer sang;
  But Autumn stops to listen, with some pang
   From those worse things the wind is moaning of.
  Only this laurel dreads no winter days:
   Take my last gift; thy heart hath sung my praise.'
