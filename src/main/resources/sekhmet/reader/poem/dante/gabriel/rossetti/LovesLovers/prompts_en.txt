  Love's Lovers By Dante Gabriel Rossetti from Youth And Change, The House of Life

  Some ladies love the jewels in Love's zone
   And gold-tipped darts he hath for painless play
  In idle scornful hours he flings away;
   And some that listen to his lure's soft tone
  Do love to deem the silver praise their own;
   Some prize his blindfold sight; and there be they
  Who kissed his wings which brought him yesterday
   And thank his wings to-day that he is flown.

  My lady only loves the heart of Love:
   Therefore Love's heart, my lady, hath for thee
  His bower of unimagined flower and tree:
   There kneels he now, and all-anhungered of
  Thine eyes grey-lit in shadowing hair above,
   Seals with thy mouth his immortality.
