  Through Death To Love By Dante Gabriel Rossetti from Youth And Change, The House of Life


  Like labour-laden moonclouds faint to flee
   From winds that sweep the winter-bitten wold,--
  Like multiform circumfluence manifold
   Of night's flood-tide,--like terrors that agree
  Of hoarse-tongued fire and inarticulate sea,--
   Even such, within some glass dimmed by our breath,
  Our hearts discern wild images of Death,
   Shadows and shoals that edge eternity.

  Howbeit athwart Death's imminent shade doth soar
   One Power, than flow of stream or flight of dove
  Sweeter to glide around, to brood above.
   Tell me, my heart;--what angel-greeted door
  Or threshold of wing-winnowed threshing-floor
   Hath guest fire-fledged as thine, whose lord is Love?
