  Silent Noon By Dante Gabriel Rossetti from Youth And Change, The House of Life

  Your hands lie open in the long fresh grass,--
   The finger-points look through the rosy blooms:
  Your eyes smile peace. The pasture gleams and glooms
   'Neath billowing skies that scatter and amass.
  All round our nest, far as the eye can pass,
   Are golden kingcup-fields with silver edge
  Where the cow-parsley skirts the hawthorn-hedge.
   'Tis visible silence, still as the hour-glass.

  Deep in the sun-searched growths the dragon-fly
   Hangs like a blue thread loosened from the sky:
  So this wing'd hour is dropt to us from above.
   Oh! clasp we to our hearts, for deathless dower,
  This close-companioned inarticulate hour
   When twofold silence was the song of love.
