  Pride Of Youth By Dante Gabriel Rossetti from Youth And Change, The House of Life

  Even as a child, of sorrow that we give
   The dead, but little in his heart can find,
  Since without need of thought to his clear mind
   Their turn it is to die and his to live:
  Even so the winged New Love smiles to receive
   Along his eddying plumes the auroral wind,
  Nor, forward glorying, casts one look behind
   Where night-rack shrouds the Old Love fugitive.

  There is a change in every hour's recall,
   And the last cowslip in the fields we see
  On the same day with the first corn-poppy.
   Alas for hourly change! Alas for all
  The loves that from his hand proud Youth lets fall,
   Even as the beads of a told rosary!
