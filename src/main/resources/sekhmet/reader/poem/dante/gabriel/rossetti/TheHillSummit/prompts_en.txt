  The Hill Summit By Dante Gabriel Rossetti from Change And Fate, The House of Life

  This feast-day of the sun, his altar there
   In the broad west has blazed for vesper-song;
  And I have loitered in the vale too long
   And gaze now a belated worshipper.
  Yet may I not forget that I was 'ware,
   So journeying, of his face at intervals
  Transfigured where the fringed horizon falls,--
   A fiery bush with coruscating hair.

  And now that I have climbed and won this height,
   I must tread downward through the sloping shade
  And travel the bewildered tracks till night.
   Yet for this hour I still may here be stayed
  And see the gold air and the silver fade
   And the last bird fly into the last light.
