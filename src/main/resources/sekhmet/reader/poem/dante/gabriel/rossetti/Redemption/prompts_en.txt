  Redemption By Dante Gabriel Rossetti from Youth And Change, The House of Life

  O Thou who at Love's hour ecstatically
   Unto my lips dost evermore present
  The body and blood of Love in sacrament;
   Whom I have neared and felt thy breath to be
  The inmost incense of his sanctuary;
   Who without speech hast owned him, and intent
  Upon his will, thy life with mine hast blent,
   And murmured o'er the cup, Remember me!--

  O what from thee the grace, for me the prize,
   And what to Love the glory,--when the whole
  Of the deep stair thou tread'st to the dim shoal
   And weary water of the place of sighs,
  And there dost work deliverance, as thine eyes
   Draw up my prisoned spirit to thy soul!
