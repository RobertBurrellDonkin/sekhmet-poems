  Supreme Surrender By Dante Gabriel Rossetti from Youth And Change, The House of Life

  O all the spirits of love that wander by
   Along the love-sown fallowfield of sleep
  My lady lies apparent; and the deep
   Calls to the deep; and no man sees but I.
  The bliss so long afar, at length so nigh,
   Rests there attained. Methinks proud Love must weep
  When Fate's control doth from his harvest reap
   The sacred hour for which the years did sigh.

  First touched, the hand now warm around my neck
   Taught memory long to mock desire: and lo!
  Across my breast the abandoned hair doth flow,
   Where one shorn tress long stirred the longing ache:
  And next the heart that trembled for its sake
   Lies the queen-heart in sovereign overthrow.
