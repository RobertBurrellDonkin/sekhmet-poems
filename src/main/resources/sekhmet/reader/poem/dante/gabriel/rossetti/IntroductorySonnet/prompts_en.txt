  Introductory Sonnet By Dante Gabriel Rossetti from Youth And Change, The House of Life

  A Sonnet is a moment's monument,--
   Memorial from the Soul's eternity
  To one dead deathless hour. Look that it be,
   Whether for lustral rite or dire portent,
  Of its own arduous fulness reverent:
   Carve it in ivory or in ebony,
  As Day or Night may rule; and let Time see
   Its flowering crest impearled and orient.

  A Sonnet is a coin: its face reveals
   The soul,--its converse, to what Power 'tis due:--
  Whether for tribute to the august appeals
   Of Life, or dower in Love's high retinue,
  It serve; or, 'mid the dark wharf's cavernous breath,
   In Charon's palm it pay the toll to Death.
