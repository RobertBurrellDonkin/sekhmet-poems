  Genius In Beauty By Dante Gabriel Rossetti from Youth And Change, The House of Life

  Beauty like hers is genius. Not the call
   Of Homer's or of Dante's heart sublime,--
  Not Michael's hand furrowing the zones of time,--
   Is more with compassed mysteries musical;
  Nay, not in Spring's or Summer's sweet footfall
   More gathered gifts exuberant Life bequeathes
  Than doth this sovereign face, whose love-spell breathes
   Even from its shadowed contour on the wall.

  As many men are poets in their youth,
   But for one sweet-strung soul the wires prolong
  Even through all change the indomitable song;
   So in likewise the envenomed years, whose tooth
  Rends shallower grace with ruin void of ruth,
   Upon this beauty's power shall wreak no wrong.
