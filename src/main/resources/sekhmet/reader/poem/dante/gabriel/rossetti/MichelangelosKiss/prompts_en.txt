  Michelangelo's Kiss By Dante Gabriel Rossetti from Change And Fate, The House of Life
  
  Great Michelangelo, with age grown bleak
   And uttermost labours, having once o'ersaid
  All grievous memories on his long life shed,
   This worst regret to one true heart could speak:--
  That when, with sorrowing love and reverence meek,
   He stooped o'er sweet Colonna's dying bed,
  His Muse and dominant Lady, spirit-wed,
   Her hand he kissed, but not her brow or cheek.

  O Buonarruoti,--good at Art's fire-wheels
   To urge her chariot!--even thus the Soul,
  Touching at length some sorely-chastened goal,
   Earns oftenest but a little: her appeals
  Were deep and mute,--lowly her claim. Let be:
   What holds for her Death's garner? And for thee?
