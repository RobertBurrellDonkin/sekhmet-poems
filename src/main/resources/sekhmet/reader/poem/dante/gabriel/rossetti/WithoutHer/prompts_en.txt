  Without Her By Dante Gabriel Rossetti from Youth And Change, The House of Life


  What of her glass without her? The blank grey
   There where the pool is blind of the moon's face.
  Her dress without her? The tossed empty space
   Of cloud-rack whence the moon has passed away.
  Her paths without her? Day's appointed sway
   Usurped by desolate night. Her pillowed place
  Without her? Tears, ah me! for love's good grace,
   And cold forgetfulness of night or day.

  What of the heart without her? Nay, poor heart,
   Of thee what word remains ere speech be still?
  A wayfarer by barren ways and chill,
   Steep ways and weary, without her thou art,
  Where the long cloud, the long wood's counterpart,
   Sheds doubled darkness up the labouring hill.
