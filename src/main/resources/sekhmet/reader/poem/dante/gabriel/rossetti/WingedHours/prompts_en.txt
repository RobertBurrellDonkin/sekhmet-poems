  Winged Hours By Dante Gabriel Rossetti from Youth And Change, The House of Life

  Each hour until we meet is as a bird
   That wings from far his gradual way along
  The rustling covert of my soul,--his song
   Still loudlier trilled through leaves more deeply stirr'd:
  But at the hour of meeting, a clear word
   Is every note he sings, in Love's own tongue;
  Yet, Love, thou know'st the sweet strain wrong,
   Through our contending kisses oft unheard.

  What of that hour at last, when for her sake
   No wing may fly to me nor song may flow;
  When, wandering round my life unleaved, I
   The bloodied feathers scattered in the brake,
  And think how she, far from me, with like eyes
   Sees through the untuneful bough the wingless skies?
