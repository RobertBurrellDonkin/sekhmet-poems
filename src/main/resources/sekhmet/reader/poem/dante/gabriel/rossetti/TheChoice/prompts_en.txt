  The Choice By Dante Gabriel Rossetti from Change And Fate, The House of Life

  I

  Eat thou and drink; tomorrow thou shalt die.
  Surely the earth, that's wise being very old,
  Needs not our help. Then loose me, love, and hold
  Thy sultry hair up from my face that I
  May pour for thee this yellow wine, brim-high,
  Till round the glass thy fingers glow like gold.
  We'll drown all hours: thy song, while hours toil'd,
  Shall leap, as fountains veil the changing sky.

  Now kiss, and think that there are really those,
  My own high-bosomed beauty, who increase
  Vain gold, vain lore, and yet might choose our way
  Through many days they toil; then comes a day
  They die not,--never having lived,--but cease;
  And round their narrow lips the mould falls close.



  II

  Watch thou and fear; to-morrow thou shalt die.
  Or art thou sure thou shalt have time for death?
  Is not the day which God's word promiseth
  To come man knows not when? In yonder sky,
  Now while we speak, the sun speeds forth: can I
  Or thou assure him of his goal? God's breath
  Even at the moment haply quickeneth
  The air to a flame; till spirits, always nigh
  Though screened and hid, shall walk the daylight here.

  And dost thou prate of all that man shall do?
  Canst thou, who hast but plagues, presume to be
  Glad in his gladness that comes after thee?
  Will his strength slay thy worm in Hell? Go to:
  Cover thy countenance, and watch, and fear.

  III

  Think thou and act; to-morrow thou shalt die.
  Outstretched in the sun's warmth upon the shore,
  Thou say'st: 'Man's measured path is all gone o'er:
  Up all his years, steeply, with strain and sigh,
  Man climb until he touched the truth; and I,
  Even I, am he whom it was destined for.'
  How should this be? Art thou then so much more
  Than they who sowed, that thou shouldst reap thereby?

  Nay, come up hither. From this wave-washed mound
  Unto the furthest flood-brim look with me;
  Then reach on with thy thought till it be drown'd.
  Miles and miles distant though the grey line be,
  And though thy soul sail leagues and leagues beyond,--
  Still, leagues beyond those leagues there is more sea.
