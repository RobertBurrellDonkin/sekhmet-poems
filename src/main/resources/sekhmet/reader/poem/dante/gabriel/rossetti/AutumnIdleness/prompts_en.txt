  Autumn Idleness By Dante Gabriel Rossetti from Change And Fate, The House of Life

  This sunlight shames November where he grieves
   In dead red leaves, and will not let him shun
  The day, though bough with bough be over-run.
   But with a blessing every glade receives
  High salutation; while from hillock-eaves
   The deer gaze calling, dappled white and dun,
  As if, being foresters of old, the sun
   Had marked them with the shade of forest-leaves.

  Here dawn to-day unveiled her magic glass;
   Here noon now gives the thirst and takes the dew;
  Till eve bring rest when other good things pass.
   And here the lost hours the lost hours renew
  While I still lead my shadow o'er the grass,
   Nor know, for longing, that which I should do.
