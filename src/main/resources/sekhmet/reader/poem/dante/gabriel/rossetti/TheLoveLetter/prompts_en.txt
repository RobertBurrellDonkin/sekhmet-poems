  The Love Letter By Dante Gabriel Rossetti from Youth And Change, The House of Life

  Warmed by her hand and shadowed by her hair
   As close she leaned and poured her heart through thee,
  Whereof the articulate throbs accompany
   The smooth black stream that makes thy whiteness fair,--
  Sweet fluttering sheet, even of her breath aware,--
   Oh let thy silent song disclose to me
  That soul wherewith her lips and eyes agree
   Like married music in Love's answering air.

  Fain had I watched her when, at some fond thought,
   Her bosom to the writing closelier press'd,
  And her breast's secrets peered into her breast;
   When, through eyes raised an instant, her soul sought
  My soul, and from the sudden confluence caught
   The words that made her love the loveliest.
