  Soul's Beauty By Dante Gabriel Rossetti from Change And Fate, The House of Life


  Under the arch of Life, where love and death,
   Terror and mystery, guard her shrine, I saw
  Beauty enthroned; and though her gaze struck awe,
   I drew it in as simply as my breath.
  Hers are the eyes which, over and beneath,
   The sky and sea bend on thee,--which can draw,
  By sea or sky or woman, to one law,
   The allotted bondman of her palm and wreath.

  This is that Lady Beauty, in whose praise
   Thy voice and hand shake still,--long known to thee
  By flying hair and fluttering hem,--the beat
   Following her daily of thy heart and feet,
  How passionately and irretrievably,
   In what fond flight, how many ways and days!
