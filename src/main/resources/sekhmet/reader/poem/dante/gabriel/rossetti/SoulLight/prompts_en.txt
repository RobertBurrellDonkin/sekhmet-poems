  Soul-Light By Dante Gabriel Rossetti from Youth And Change, The House of Life

  What other woman could be loved like you,
   Or how of you should love possess his fill?
  After the fulness of all rapture, still,--
   As at the end of some deep avenue
  A tender glamour of day,--there comes to view
   Far in your eyes a yet more hungering thrill,--
  Such fire as Love's soul-winnowing hands distil
   Even from his inmost arc of light and dew.

  And as the traveller triumphs with the sun,
   Glorying in heat's mid-height, yet startide brings
  Wonder new-born, and still fresh transport springs
   From limpid lambent hours of day begun;--
  Even so, through eyes and voice, your soul doth move
   My soul with changeful light of infinite love.
