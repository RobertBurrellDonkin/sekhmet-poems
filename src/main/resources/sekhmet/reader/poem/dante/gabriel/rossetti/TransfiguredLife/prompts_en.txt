  Transfigured Life By Dante Gabriel Rossetti from Change And Fate, The House of Life

  As growth of form or momentary glance
   In a child's features will recall to mind
  The father's with the mother's face combin'd,--
   Sweet interchange that memories still enhance:
  And yet, as childhood's years and youth's advance,
   The gradual mouldings leave one stamp behind,
  Till in the blended likeness now we find
   A separate man's or woman's countenance:--

  So in the Song, the singer's Joy and Pain,
   Its very parents, evermore expand
  To bid the passion's fullgrown birth remain,
  By Art's transfiguring essence subtly spann'd;
   And from that song-cloud shaped as a man's hand
  There comes the sound as of abundant rain.
