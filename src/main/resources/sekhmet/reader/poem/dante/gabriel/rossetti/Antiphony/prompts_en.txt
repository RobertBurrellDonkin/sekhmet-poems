  Antiphony By Dante Gabriel Rossetti from Youth And Change, The House of Life

  'I love you, sweet: how can you ever learn
   How much I love you?' 'You I love even so,
  And so I learn it.' 'Sweet, you cannot know
   How fair you are.' 'If fair enough to earn
  Your love, so much is all my love's concern.'
   'My love grows hourly, sweet.' 'Mine too doth grow,
  Yet love seemed full so many hours ago!'
   Thus lovers speak, till kisses claim their turn.

  Ah! happy they to whom such words as these
   In youth have served for speech the whole day long,
  Hour after hour, remote from the world's throng,
   Work, contest, fame, all life's confederate pleas,--
  What while Love breathed in sighs and silences
   Through two blent souls one rapturous undersong.
