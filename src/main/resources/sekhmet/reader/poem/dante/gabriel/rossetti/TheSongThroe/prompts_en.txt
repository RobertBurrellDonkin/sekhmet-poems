  The Song Throe By Dante Gabriel Rossetti from Change And Fate, The House of Life

  By thine own tears thy song must tears beget,
   O Singer! Magic mirror thou hast none
  Except thy manifest heart; and save thine own
   Anguish or ardour, else no amulet.
  Cisterned in Pride, verse is the feathery jet
   Of soulless air-flung fountains; nay, more dry
  Than the Dead Sea for throats that thirst and sigh,
   That song o'er which no singer's lids grew wet.

  The Song-god--He the Sun-god--is no slave
   Of thine: thy Hunter he, who for thy soul
  Fledges his shaft: to no august control
   Of thy skilled hand his quivered store he gave:
  But if thy lips' loud cry leap to his smart,
   The inspir'd recoil shall pierce thy brother's heart.
