  Last Fire By Dante Gabriel Rossetti from Youth And Change, The House of Life

  Love, through your spirit and mine what summer eve
   Now glows with glory of all things possess'd,
  Since this day's sun of rapture filled the west
   And the light sweetened as the fire took leave?
  Awhile now softlier let your bosom heave,
   As in Love's harbour, even that loving breast,
  All care takes refuge while we sink to rest,
   And mutual dreams the bygone bliss retrieve.

  Many the days that Winter keeps in store,
   Sunless throughout, or whose brief sun-glimpses
  Scarce shed the heaped snow through the naked trees.
   This day at least was Summer's paramour,
  Sun-coloured to the imperishable core
   With sweet well-being of love and full heart's ease.
