  The Kiss By Dante Gabriel Rossetti from Youth And Change, The House of Life

  What smouldering senses in death's sick delay
   Or seizure of malign vicissitude
  Can rob this body of honour, or denude
   This soul of wedding-raiment worn to-day?
  For lo! even now my lady's lips did play
   With these my lips such consonant interlude
  As laurelled Orpheus longed for when he wooed
   The half-drawn hungering face with that last lay.

  I was a child beneath her touch,--a man
   When breast to breast we clung, even I and she,--
  A spirit when her spirit looked through me,--
   A god when all our life-breath met to fan
  Our life-blood, till love's emulous ardours ran,
   Fire within fire, desire in deity.
