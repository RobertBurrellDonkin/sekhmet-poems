  The Portrait By Dante Gabriel Rossetti from Youth And Change, The House of Life

  O Lord of all compassionate control,
   O Love! let this my lady's picture glow
  Under my hand to praise her name, and show
   Even of her inner self the perfect whole:
  That he who seeks her beauty's furthest goal,
   Beyond the light that the sweet glances throw
  And refluent wave of the sweet smile, may know
   The very sky and sea-line of her soul.

  Lo! it is done. Above the long lithe throat
   The mouth's mould testifies of voice and kiss,
  The shadowed eyes remember and foresee.
   Her face is made her shrine. Let all men note
  That in all years (O Love, thy gift is this!)
   They that would look on her must come to me.
