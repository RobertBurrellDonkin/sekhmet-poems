  Body's Beauty By Dante Gabriel Rossetti from Change And Fate, The House of Life

  Of Adam's first wife, Lilith, it is told
   (The witch he loved before the gift of Eve,)
  That, ere the snake's, her sweet tongue could deceive,
   And her enchanted hair was the first gold.
  And still she sits, young while the earth is old,
   And, subtly of herself contemplative,
  Draws men to watch the bright web she can weave,
   Till heart and body and life are in its hold.

  The rose and poppy are her flowers; for where
   Is he not found, O Lilith, whom shed scent
  And soft-shed kisses and soft sleep shall snare?
   Lo! as that youth's eyes burned at thine, so went
  Thy spell through him, and left his straight neck bent
   And round his heart one strangling golden hair.
