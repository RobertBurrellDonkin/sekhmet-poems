  Heart's Hope By Dante Gabriel Rossetti from Youth And Change, The House of Life

  By what word's power, the key of paths untrod,
   Shall I the difficult deeps of Love explore,
  Till parted waves of Song yield up the shore
   Even as that sea which Israel crossed dry-shod?
  For lo! in some poor rhythmic period,
   Lady, I fain would tell how evermore
  Thy soul I know not from thy body, nor
   Thee from myself, neither our love from God.

  Yea, in God's name, and Love's, and thine, would I
   Draw from one loving heart such evidence
  As to all hearts all things shall signify;
   Tender as dawn's first hill-fire, and intense
  As instantaneous penetrating sense,
   In Spring's birth-hour, of other Springs gone by.
