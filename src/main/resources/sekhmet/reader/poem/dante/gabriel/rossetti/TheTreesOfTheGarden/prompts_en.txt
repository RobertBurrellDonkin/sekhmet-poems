  The Trees of The Garden By Dante Gabriel Rossetti from Change And Fate, The House of Life

  Ye who have passed Death's haggard hills; and ye
   Whom trees that knew your sires shall cease to know
  And still stand silent:--is it all a show,
   A wisp that laughs upon the wall?--decree
  Of some inexorable supremacy
   Which ever, as man strains his blind surmise
  From depth to ominous depth, looks past his eyes,
   Sphinx-faced with unabashed augury?

  Nay, rather question the Earth's self. Invoke
   The storm-felled forest-trees moss-grown to-day
  Whose roots are hillocks where the children play;
   Or ask the silver sapling 'neath what yoke
  Those stars, his spray-crown's clustering gems, shall wage
   Their journey still when his boughs shrink with age.
