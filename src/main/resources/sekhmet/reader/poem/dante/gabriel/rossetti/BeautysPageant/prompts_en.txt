  Beauty's Pageant By Dante Gabriel Rossetti from Youth And Change, The House of Life

  What dawn-pulse at the heart of heaven, or last
   Incarnate flower of culminating day,--
  What marshalled marvels on the skirts of May,
   Or song full-quired, sweet June's encomiast;
  What glory of change by nature's hand amass'd
   Can vie with all those moods of varying grace
  Which o'er one loveliest woman's form and face
   Within this hour, within this room, have pass'd?

  Love's very vesture and elect disguise
   Was each fine movement,--wonder new-begot
  Of lily or swan or swan-stemmed galiot;
   Joy to his sight who now the sadlier sighs,
  Parted again; and sorrow yet for eyes
   Unborn that read these words and saw her not.
