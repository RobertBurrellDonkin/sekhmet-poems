  Lovesight By Dante Gabriel Rossetti from Youth And Change, The House of Life

  When do I see thee most, beloved one?
   When in the light the spirits of mine eyes
  Before thy face, their altar, solemnize
   The worship of that Love through thee made known?
  Or when in the dusk hours, (we two alone,)
   Close-kissed and eloquent of still replies
  Thy twilight-hidden glimmering visage lies,
   And my soul only sees thy soul its own?

  O love, my love! if I no more should see
   Thyself, nor on the earth the shadow of thee,
  Nor image of thine eyes in any spring,--
   How then should sound upon Life's darkening slope
  The ground-whirl of the perished leaves of Hope,
   The wind of Death's imperishable wing?
