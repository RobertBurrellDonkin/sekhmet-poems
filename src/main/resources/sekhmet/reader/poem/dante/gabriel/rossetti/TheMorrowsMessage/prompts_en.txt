  The Morrow's Message By Dante Gabriel Rossetti from Youth And Change, The House of Life

  'Thou Ghost,' I said, 'and is thy name To-day?--
   Yesterday's son, with such an abject brow!--
  And can To-morrow be more pale than thou?'
   While yet I spoke, the silence answered: 'Yea,
  Henceforth our issue is all grieved and grey,
   And each beforehand makes such poor avow
  As of old leaves beneath the budding bough
   Or night-drift that the sundawn shreds away.'

  Then cried I: 'Mother of many malisons,
   O Earth, receive me to thy dusty bed!'
  But therewithal the tremulous silence said:
   'Lo! Love yet bids thy lady greet thee once:--
  Yea, twice,--whereby thy life is still the sun's;
   And thrice,--whereby the shadow of death is dead.'
