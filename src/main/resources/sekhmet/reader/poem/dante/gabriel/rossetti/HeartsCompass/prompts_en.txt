  Heart's Compass By Dante Gabriel Rossetti from Youth And Change, The House of Life


  Sometimes thou seem'st not as thyself alone,
   But as the meaning of all things that are;
  A breathless wonder, shadowing forth afar
   Some heavenly solstice hushed and halcyon;
  Whose unstirred lips are music's visible tone;
   Whose eyes the sun-gate of the soul unbar,
  Being of its furthest fires oracular;--
   The evident heart of all life sown and mown.

  Even such Love is; and is not thy name Love?
   Yea, by thy hand the Love-god rends apart
  All gathering clouds of Night's ambiguous art;
   Flings them far down, and sets thine eyes above;
  And simply, as some gage of flower or glove,
   Stakes with a smile the world against thy heart.
