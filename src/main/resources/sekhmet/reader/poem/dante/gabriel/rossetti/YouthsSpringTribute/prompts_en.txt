  Youth's Spring-Tribute By Dante Gabriel Rossetti from Youth And Change, The House of Life

  On this sweet bank your head thrice sweet and dear
   I lay, and spread your hair on either side,
  And see the newborn wood flowers bashful-eyed
   Look through the golden tresses here and there.
  On these debateable* borders of the year
   Spring's foot half falters; scarce she yet may know
  The leafless blackthorn-blossom from the snow;
   And through her bowers the wind's way still is clear.

  But April's sun strikes down the glades to-day;
   So shut your eyes upturned, and feel my kiss
  Creep, as the Spring now thrills through every spray,
   Up your warm throat to your warm lips: for this
  Is even the hour of Love's sworn suitservice,
   With whom cold hearts are counted castaway.
