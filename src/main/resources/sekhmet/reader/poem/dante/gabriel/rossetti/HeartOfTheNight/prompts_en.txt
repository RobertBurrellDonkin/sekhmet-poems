  Heart Of The Night By Dante Gabriel Rossetti from Change And Fate, The House of Life

  From child to youth; from youth to arduous man;
   From lethargy to fever of the heart;
  From faithful life to dream-dowered days apart;
   From trust to doubt; from doubt to brink of ban;--
  Thus much of change in one swift cycle ran
   Till now. Alas, the soul!--how soon must she
  Accept her primal immortality,--
   The flesh resume its dust whence it began?

  O Lord of work and peace! O Lord of life!
   O Lord, the awful Lord of will! though late,
  Even yet renew this soul with duteous breath:
   That when the peace is garnered in from strife,
  The work retrieved, the will regenerate,
   This soul may see thy face, O Lord of death!
