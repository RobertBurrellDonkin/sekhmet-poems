  Love-Sweetness By Dante Gabriel Rossetti from Youth And Change, The House of Life

  Sweet dimness of her loosened hair's downfall
   About thy face; her sweet hands round thy head
  In gracious fostering union garlanded,
   Her tremulous smiles, her glances' sweet recall
  Of love; her murmuring sighs memorial;
   Her mouth's culled sweetness by thy kisses shed
  On cheeks and neck and eyelids, and so led
   Back to her mouth which answers there for all:--

  What sweeter than these things, except the thing
   In lacking which all these would lose their sweet:--
  The confident heart's still fervour: the swift beat
   And soft subsidence of the spirit's wing,
  Then when it feels, in cloud--girt wayfaring,
   The breath of kindred plumes against its feet?
