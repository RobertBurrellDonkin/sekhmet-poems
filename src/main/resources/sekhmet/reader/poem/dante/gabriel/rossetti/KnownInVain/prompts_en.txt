  Known In Vain By Dante Gabriel Rossetti from Change And Fate, The House of Life

  As two whose love, first foolish, widening scope,
   Knows suddenly, with music high and soft,
  The Holy of holies; who because they scoff'd
   Are now amazed with shame, nor dare to cope
  With the whole truth aloud, lest heaven should ope;
   Yet, at their meetings, laugh not as they
  In speech; nor speak, at length; but sitting oft
   Together, within hopeless sight of hope
  For hours are silent:--So it happeneth
   When Work and Will awake too late, to gaze
  After their life sailed by, and hold their breath.
   Ah! who shall dare to search through what sad maze
  Thenceforth their incommunicable ways
   Follow the desultory feet of Death?
