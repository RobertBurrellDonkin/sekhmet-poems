  Farewell To The Glen By Dante Gabriel Rossetti from Change And Fate, The House of Life

  Sweet stream-fed glen, why say 'farewell' to thee
   Who far'st so well and find'st for ever smooth
  The brow of Time where man may read no ruth?
   Nay, do thou rather say 'farewell' to me,
  Who now fare forth in bitterer fantasy
   Than erst was mine where other shade might soothe
  By other streams, what while in fragrant youth
   The bliss of being sad made melancholy.

  And yet, farewell! For better shalt thou fare
   When children bathe sweet faces in thy flow
  And happy lovers blend sweet shadows there
   In hours to come, than when an hour ago
  Thine echoes had but one man's sighs to bear
   And thy trees whispered what he feared to know.
