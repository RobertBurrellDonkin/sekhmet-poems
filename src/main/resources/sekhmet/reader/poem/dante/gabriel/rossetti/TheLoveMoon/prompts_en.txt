  The Love Moon By Dante Gabriel Rossetti from Youth And Change, The House of Life

  'When that dead face, bowered in the furthest years,
   Which once was all the life years held for thee,
  Can now scarce bide the tides of memory
   Cast on thy soul a little spray of tears,--
  How canst thou gaze into these eyes of hers
   Whom now thy heart delights in, and not see
  Within each orb Love's philtred euphrasy
   Make them of buried troth remembrancers?'

  'Nay, pitiful Love, nay, loving Pity! Well
   Thou knowest that in these twain I have confess'd
  Two very voices of thy summoning bell.
   Nay, Master, shall not Death make manifest
  In these the culminant changes which approve
   The love-moon that must light my soul to Love?'
