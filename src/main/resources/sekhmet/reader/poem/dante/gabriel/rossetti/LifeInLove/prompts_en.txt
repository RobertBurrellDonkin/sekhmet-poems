  Life-in-Love By Dante Gabriel Rossetti from Youth And Change, The House of Life

  Not in thy body is thy life at all
   But in this lady's lips and hands and eyes;
  Through these she yields the life that vivifies
   What else were sorrow's servant and death's thrall.
  Look on thyself without her, and recall
   The waste remembrance and forlorn surmise
  That lived but in a dead-drawn breath of sighs
   O'er vanished hours and hours eventual.

  Even so much life hath the poor tress of hair
   Which, stored apart, is all love hath to show
  For heart-beats and for fire-heats long ago;
   Even so much life endures unknown, even where,
  'Mid change the changeless night environeth,
   Lies all that golden hair undimmed in death.
