  Parted Love By Dante Gabriel Rossetti from Youth And Change, The House of Life

  What shall be said of this embattled day
   And armed occupation of this night
  By all thy foes beleaguered,--now when sight
   Nor sound denotes the loved one far away?
  Of these thy vanquished hours what shalt thou say,--
   As every sense to which she dealt delight
  Now labours lonely o'er the stark noon-height
   To reach the sunset's desolate disarray?

  Stand still, fond fettered wretch! while Memory's art
   Parades the Past before thy face, and lures
  Thy spirit to her passionate portraitures:
   Till the tempestuous tide-gates flung apart
  Flood with wild will the hollows of thy heart,
   And thy heart rends thee, and thy body endures.
