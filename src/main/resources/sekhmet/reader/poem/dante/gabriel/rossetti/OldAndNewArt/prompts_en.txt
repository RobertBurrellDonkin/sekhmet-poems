  Old And New Art By Dante Gabriel Rossetti from Change And Fate, The House of Life

  I. Saint Luke The Painter

  Give honour unto Luke Evangelist;
  For he it was (the aged legends say)
  Who first taught Art to fold her hands and pray.
  Scarcely at once she dared to rend the mist
  Of devious symbols: but soon having wist
  How sky-breadth and field-silence and this day
  Are symbols also in some deeper way,
  She looked through these to God and was God's priest.

  And if, past noon, her toil began to irk,
  And she sought talismans, and turned in vain
  To soulless self-reflections of man's skill,
  Yet now, in this the twilight, she might still
  Kneel in the latter grass to pray again,
  Ere the night cometh and she may not work.



  II. Not As These

  'I am not as these are,' the poet saith
  In youth's pride, and the painter, among men
  At bay, where never pencil comes nor pen,
  And shut about with his own frozen breath.
  To others, for whom only rhyme wins faith
  As poets,--only paint as painters,--then
  He turns in the cold silence; and again
  Shrinking, 'I am not as these are,' he saith.

  And say that this is so, what follows it?
  For were thine eyes set backwards in thine head,
  Such words were well; but they see on, and far.
  Unto the lights of the great Past, new-lit
  Fair for the Future's track, look thou instead,--
  Say thou instead 'I am not as _these_ are.'

  III. The Husbandman

  Though God, as one that is an householder,
  Called these to labour in his vine-yard first,
  Before the husk of darkness was well burst
  Bidding them grope their way out and bestir,
  (Who, questioned of their wages, answered, 'Sir,
  Unto each man a penny:') though the worst
  Burthen of heat was theirs and the dry thirst:
  Though God hath since found none such as these were
  To do their work like them:--Because of this
  Stand not ye idle in the market-place.
  Which of ye knoweth _he_ is not that last
  Who may be first by faith and will?--yea, his
  The hand which after the appointed days
  And hours shall give a Future to their Past?
