  Bridal Birth By Dante Gabriel Rossetti from Youth And Change, The House of Life

  As when desire, long darkling, dawns, and first
   The mother looks upon the new-born child,
  Even so my Lady stood at gaze and smiled
   When her soul knew at length the Love it nursed.
  Born with her life, creature of poignant thirst
   And exquisite hunger, at her heart Love lay
  Quickening in darkness, till a voice that day
   Cried on him, and the bonds of birth were burst.

  Now, shielded in his wings, our faces yearn
   Together, as his fullgrown feet now range
  The grove, and his warm hands our couch prepare:
   Till to his song our bodiless souls in turn
  Be born his children, when Death's nuptial change
   Leaves us for light the halo of his hair.
