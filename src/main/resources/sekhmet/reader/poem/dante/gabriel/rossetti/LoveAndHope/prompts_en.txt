  Love And Hope By Dante Gabriel Rossetti from Youth And Change, The House of Life

  Bless love and hope. Full many a withered year
  Whirled past us, eddying to its chill doomsday;
  And clasped together where the blown leaves lay,
  We long have knelt and wept full many a tear.
  Yet lo! one hour at last, the Spring's compeer,
  Flutes softly to us from some green byway:
  Those years, those tears are dead, but only they:--
  Bless love and hope, true soul; for we are here.

  Cling heart to heart; nor of this hour demand
  Whether in very truth, when we are dead,
  Our hearts shall wake to know Love's golden head
  Sole sunshine of the imperishable land;
  Or but discern, through night's unfeatured scope,
  Scorn-fired at length the illusive eyes of Hope
