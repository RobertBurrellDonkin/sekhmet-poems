  Hope Overtaken By Dante Gabriel Rossetti from Youth And Change, The House of Life


  I deemed thy garments, O my Hope, were grey,
   So far I viewed thee. Now the space between
  Is passed at length; and garmented in green
   Even as in days of yore thou stand'st to-day.
  Ah God! and but for lingering dull dismay,
   On all that road our footsteps erst had been
  Even thus commingled, and our shadows seen
   Blent on the hedgerows and the water-way.

  O Hope of mine whose eyes are living love,
   No eyes but hers,--O Love and Hope the same!--
  Lean close to me, for now the sinking sun
   That warmed our feet scarce gilds our hair above.
  O hers thy voice and very hers thy name!
   Alas, cling round me, for the day is done!
