  The Dark Glass By Dante Gabriel Rossetti from Youth And Change, The House of Life

  Not I myself know all my love for thee:
   How should I reach so far, who cannot weigh
  To-morrow's dower by gage of yesterday?
   Shall birth and death, and all dark names that be
  As doors and windows bared to some loud sea,
   Lash deaf mine ears and blind my face with spray;
  And shall my sense pierce love,--the last relay
   And ultimate outpost of eternity?

  Lo! what am I to Love, the lord of all?
   One murmuring shell he gathers from the sand,--
  One little heart-flame sheltered in his hand.
   Yet through thine eyes he grants me clearest call
  And veriest touch of powers primordial
   That any hour-girt life may understand.
