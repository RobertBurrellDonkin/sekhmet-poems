  Inclusiveness By Dante Gabriel Rossetti from Change And Fate, The House of Life

  The changing guests, each in a different mood,
   Sit at the roadside table and arise:
  And every life among them in likewise
   Is a soul's board set daily with new food.
  What man has bent o'er his son's sleep, to brood
   How that face shall watch his when cold it lies?--
  Or thought, as his own mother kissed his eyes,
   Of what her kiss was when his father wooed?

  May not this ancient room thou sit'st in dwell
   In separate living souls for joy or pain?
  Nay, all its corners may be painted plain
   Where Heaven shows pictures of some life spent well;
  And may be stamped, a memory all in vain,
   Upon the sight of lidless eyes in Hell.
