  Death In Love By Dante Gabriel Rossetti from Youth And Change, The House of Life

  There came an image in Life's retinue
   That had Love's wings and bore his gonfalon:
  Fair was the web, and nobly wrought thereon,
   O soul-sequestered face, thy form and hue!
  Bewildering sounds, such as Spring wakens to,
   Shook in its folds; and through my heart its power
  Sped trackless as the immemorable hour
   When birth's dark portal groaned and all was new.

  But a veiled woman followed, and she caught
   The banner round its staff, to furl and cling,--
  Then plucked a feather from the bearer's wing,
   And held it to his lips that stirred it not,
  And said to me, 'Behold, there is no breath:
   I and this Love are one, and I am Death.'
