  Stillborn Love By Dante Gabriel Rossetti from Youth And Change, The House of Life


  The hour which might have been yet might not be,
   Which man's and woman's heart conceived and bore
  Yet whereof life was barren,--on what shore
   Bides it the breaking of Time's weary sea?
  Bondchild of all consummate joys set free,
   It somewhere sighs and serves, and mute before
  The house of Love, hears through the echoing door
   His hours elect in choral consonancy.

  But lo! what wedded souls now hand in hand
   Together tread at last the immortal strand
  With eyes where burning memory lights love home?
   Lo! how the little outcast hour has turned
  And leaped to them and in their faces yearned:--
   'I am your child: O parents, ye have come!'
