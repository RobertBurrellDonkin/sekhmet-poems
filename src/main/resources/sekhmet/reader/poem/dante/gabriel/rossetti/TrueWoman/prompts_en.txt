  True Woman By Dante Gabriel Rossetti from Youth And Change, The House of Life

  I. HERSELF

  To be a sweetness more desired than Spring;
   A bodily beauty more acceptable
  Than the wild rose-tree's arch that crowns the fell;
   To be an essence more environing
  Than wine's drained juice; a music ravishing
   More than the passionate pulse of Philomel;--
  To be all this 'neath one soft bosom's swell
   That is the flower of life:--how strange a thing!

  How strange a thing to be what Man can know
   But as a sacred secret! Heaven's own screen
  Hides her soul's purest depth and loveliest glow;
   Closely withheld, as all things most unseen,--
  The wave-bowered pearl, the heart-shaped seal of green
   That flecks the snowdrop underneath the snow.


  II. HER LOVE

  She loves him; for her infinite soul is Love,
   And he her lodestar. Passion in her is
  A glass facing his fire, where the bright bliss
   Is mirrored, and the heat returned. Yet move
  That glass, a stranger's amorous flame to prove,
   And it shall turn, by instant contraries,
  Ice to the moon; while her pure fire to his
   For whom it burns, clings close i' the heart's alcove.

  Lo! they are one. With wifely breast to breast
   And circling arms, she welcomes all command
  Of love,--her soul to answering ardours fann'd:
   Yet as morn springs or twilight sinks to rest,
  Ah! who shall say she deems not loveliest
   The hour of sisterly sweet hand-in-hand?


  III. HER HEAVEN

  If to grow old in Heaven is to grow young,
   (As the Seer saw and said,) then blest were he
  With youth forevermore, whose heaven should be
   True Woman, she whom these weak notes have sung.
  Here and hereafter,--choir-strains of her tongue,--
   Sky-spaces of her eyes,--sweet signs that flee
  About her soul's immediate sanctuary,--
   Were Paradise all uttermost worlds among.

  The sunrise blooms and withers on the hill
   Like any hillflower; and the noblest troth
  Dies here to dust. Yet shall Heaven's promise clothe
   Even yet those lovers who have cherished still
  This test for love:--in every kiss sealed fast
   To feel the first kiss and forebode the last.
