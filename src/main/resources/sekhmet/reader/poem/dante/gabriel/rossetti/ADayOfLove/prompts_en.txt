  A Day Of Love By Dante Gabriel Rossetti from Youth And Change, The House of Life

  Those envied places which do know her well,
   And are so scornful of this lonely place,
  Even now for once are emptied of her grace:
   Nowhere but here she is: and while Love's spell
  From his predominant presence doth compel
   All alien hours, an outworn populace,
  The hours of Love fill full the echoing space
   With sweet confederate music favourable.

  Now many memories make solicitous
   The delicate love-lines of her mouth, till, lit
  With quivering fire, the words take wing from it;
   As here between our kisses we sit thus
  Speaking of things remembered, and so sit
   Speechless while things forgotten call to us.
