  Nuptial Sleep By Dante Gabriel Rossetti from Youth And Change, The House of Life

  At length their long kiss severed, with sweet smart:
   And as the last slow sudden drops are shed
  From sparkling eaves when all the storm has fled,
   So singly flagged the pulses of each heart.
  Their bosoms sundered, with the opening start
   Of married flowers to either side outspread
  From the knit stem; yet still their mouths, burnt red,
   Fawned on each other where they lay apart.

  Sleep sank them lower than the tide of dreams,
   And their dreams watched them sink, and slid away.
  Slowly their souls swam up again, through gleams
   Of watered light and dull drowned waifs of day;
  Till from some wonder of new woods and streams
   He woke, and wondered more: for there she lay.
