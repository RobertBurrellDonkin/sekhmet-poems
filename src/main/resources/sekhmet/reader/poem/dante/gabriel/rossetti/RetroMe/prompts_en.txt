  'RETRO ME, SATHANA!' By Dante Gabriel Rossetti from Change And Fate, The House of Life

  Get thee behind me. Even as, heavy-curled,
   Stooping against the wind, a charioteer
  Is snatched from out his chariot by the hair,
   So shall Time be; and as the void car, hurled
  Abroad by reinless steeds, even so the world:
   Yea, even as chariot-dust upon the air,
  It shall be sought and not found anywhere.
   Get thee behind me, Satan. Oft unfurled,
  Thy perilous wings can beat and break like lath
   Much mightiness of men to win thee praise.
  Leave these weak feet to tread in narrow ways.
   Thou still, upon the broad vine-sheltered path,
  Mayst wait the turning of the phials of wrath
   For certain years, for certain months and days.
