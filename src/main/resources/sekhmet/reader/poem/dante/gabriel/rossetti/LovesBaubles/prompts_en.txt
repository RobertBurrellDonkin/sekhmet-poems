  Love's Baubles By Dante Gabriel Rossetti from Youth And Change, The House of Life

  I stood where Love in brimming armfuls bore
   Slight wanton flowers and foolish toys of fruit:
  And round him ladies thronged in warm pursuit,
   Fingered and lipped and proffered the strange store:
  And from one hand the petal and the core
   Savoured of sleep; and cluster and curled shoot
  Seemed from another hand like shame's salute,--
   Gifts that I felt my cheek was blushing for.

  At last Love bade my Lady give the same:
   And as I looked, the dew was light thereon;
  And as I took them, at her touch they shone
   With inmost heaven-hue of the heart of flame.
  And then Love said: 'Lo! when the hand is hers,
   Follies of love are love's true ministers.'
