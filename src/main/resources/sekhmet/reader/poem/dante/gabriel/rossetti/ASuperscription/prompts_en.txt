  A Superscription By Dante Gabriel Rossetti from Change And Fate, The House of Life


  Look in my face; my name is Might-have-been;
   I am also called No-more, Too-late, Farewell;
  Unto thine ear I hold the dead-sea shell
   Cast up thy Life's foam-fretted feet between;
  Unto thine eyes the glass where that is seen
   Which had Life's form and Love's, but by my spell
  Is now a shaken shadow intolerable,
   Of ultimate things unuttered the frail screen.

  Mark me, how still I am! But should there dart
   One moment through thy soul the soft surprise
  Of that winged Peace which lulls the breath of sighs,
   Then shalt thou see me smile, and turn apart
  Thy visage to mine ambush at thy heart
   Sleepless with cold commemorative eyes.
