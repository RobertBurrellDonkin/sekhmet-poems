  Life The Beloved By Dante Gabriel Rossetti from Change And Fate, The House of Life

  As thy friend's face, with shadow of soul o'erspread,
   Somewhile unto thy sight perchance hath been
  Ghastly and strange, yet never so is seen
   In thought, but to all fortunate favour wed;
  As thy love's death-bound features never dead
   To memory's glass return, but contravene
  Frail fugitive days, and always keep, I ween
   Than all new life a livelier lovelihead:--

  So Life herself, thy spirit's friend and love,
   Even still as Spring's authentic harbinger
  Glows with fresh hours for hope to glorify;
   Though pale she lay when in the winter grove
  Her funeral flowers were snow-flakes shed on her
   And the red wings of frost-fire rent the sky.
