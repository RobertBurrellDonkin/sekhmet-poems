  The One Hope By Dante Gabriel Rossetti from Change And Fate, The House of Life


  When all desire at last and all regret
   Go hand in hand to death, and all is vain,
  What shall assuage the unforgotten pain
   And teach the unforgetful to forget?
  Shall Peace be still a sunk stream long unmet,--
   Or may the soul at once in a green plain
  Stoop through the spray of some sweet life-fountain
   And cull the dew-drenched flowering amulet?

  Ah! when the wan soul in that golden air
   Between the scriptured petals softly blown
  Peers breathless for the gift of grace unknown,
   Ah! let none other written spell soe'er
  But only the one Hope's one name be there,--
   Not less nor more, but even that word alone.
