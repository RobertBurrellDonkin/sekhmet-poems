The End Of May By William Morris


How the wind howls this morn
 About the end of May,
And drives June on apace
 To mock the world forlorn
And the world's joy passed away
 And my unlonged-for face!
The world's joy passed away;
 For no more may I deem
That any folk are glad
 To see the dawn of day
Sunder the tangled dream
 Wherein no grief they had.
Ah, through the tangled dream
 Where others have no grief
Ever it fares with me
 That fears and treasons stream
And dumb sleep slays belief
 Whatso therein may be.
Sleep slayeth all belief
 Until the hopeless light
Wakes at the birth of June
 More lying tales to weave,
More love in woe's despite,
 More hope to perish soon.
