From The Upland To The Sea By William Morris

Shall we wake one morn of spring,
 Glad at heart of everything,
Yet pensive with the thought of eve?
 Then the white house shall we leave.
Pass the wind-flowers and the bays,
 Through the garth, and go our ways,
Wandering down among the meads
 Till our very joyance needs
Rest at last; till we shall come
 To that Sun-god's lonely home,
Lonely on the hillside grey,
 Whence the sheep have gone away;
Lonely till the feast-time is,
 When with prayer and praise of bliss,
Thither comes the country side.
 There awhile shall we abide,
Sitting low down in the porch
 By that image with the torch:
Thy one white hand laid upon
 The black pillar that was won
From the far-off Indian mine;
 And my hand nigh touching thine,
But not touching; and thy gown
 Fair with spring-flowers cast adown
From thy bosom and thy brow.
 There the south-west wind shall blow
Through thine hair to reach my cheek,
 As thou sittest, nor mayst speak,
Nor mayst move the hand I kiss
 For the very depth of bliss;
Nay, nor turn thine eyes to me.
 Then desire of the great sea
Nigh enow, but all unheard,
 In the hearts of us is stirred,
And we rise, we twain at last,
 And the daffodils downcast,
Feel thy feet and we are gone
 From the lonely Sun-Crowned one,
Then the meads fade at our back,
 And the spring day 'gins to lack
That fresh hope that once it had;
 But we twain grow yet more glad,
And apart no more may go
 When the grassy slope and low
Dieth in the shingly sand:
 Then we wander hand in hand
By the edges of the sea,
 And I weary more for thee
Than if far apart we were,
 With a space of desert drear
'Twixt thy lips and mine, O love!
 Ah, my joy, my joy thereof!
