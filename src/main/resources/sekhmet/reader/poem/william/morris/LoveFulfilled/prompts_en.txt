Love Fulfilled By William Morris


Hast thou longed through weary days
 For the sight of one loved face?
Hast thou cried aloud for rest,
 Mid the pain of sundering hours;
Cried aloud for sleep and death,
 Since the sweet unhoped for best
Was a shadow and a breath?
 O, long now, for no fear lowers
O'er these faint feet-kissing flowers.
 O, rest now; and yet in sleep
All thy longing shalt thou keep.

Thou shalt rest and have no fear
 Of a dull awaking near,
Of a life for ever blind,
 Uncontent and waste and wide.
Thou shalt wake and think it sweet
 That thy love is near and kind.
Sweeter still for lips to meet;
 Sweetest that thine heart doth hide
Longing all unsatisfied
 With all longing's answering
Howsoever close ye cling.

Thou rememberest how of old
 E'en thy very pain grew cold,
How thou might'st not measure bliss
 E'en when eyes and hands drew nigh.
Thou rememberest all regret
 For the scarce remembered kiss.
The lost dream of how they met,
 Mouths once parched with misery.
Then seemed Love born but to die,
 Now unrest, pain, bliss are one,
Love, unhidden and alone.
