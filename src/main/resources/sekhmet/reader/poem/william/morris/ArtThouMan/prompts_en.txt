Art thou man, art thou maid By William Morris

  Art thou man, art thou maid, through the long grass a-going?
    For short shirt thou bearest, and no beard I see,
  And the last wind ere moonrise about thee is blowing.
    Would'st thou meet with thy maiden or look'st thou for me?

  Bright shineth the moon now, I see thy gown longer;
    And down by the hazels Joan meeteth her lad:
  But hard is thy palm, lass, and scarcely were stronger
    What's grip than thine hand-kiss that maketh me glad.

  And now as the candles shine on us and over,
    Full shapely thy feet are, but brown on the floor,
  As the bare-footed mowers amidst of the clover
    When the gowk's note is broken and mid-June is o'er.

  O hard are mine hand-palms because on the ridges
    I carried the reap-hook and smote for thy sake;
  And in the hot noon-tide I beat off the midges
    As thou slep'st 'neath the linden o'er-loathe to awake.

  And brown are my feet now because the sun burneth
    High up on the down-side amidst of the sheep,
  And there in the hollow wherefrom the wind turneth,
    Thou lay'st in my lap while I sung thee to sleep.

  O friend of the earth, O come nigher and nigher,
    Thou art sweet with the sun's kiss as meads of the May,
  O'er the rocks of the waste, o'er the water and fire,
    Will I follow thee, love, till earth waneth away.
