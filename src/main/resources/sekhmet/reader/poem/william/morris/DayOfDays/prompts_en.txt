The Day Of Days By William Morris

Each eve earth falleth down the dark,
 As though its hope were o'er;
Yet lurks the sun when day is done
 Behind to-morrow's door.

Grey grows the dawn while men-folk sleep,
 Unseen spreads on the light,
Till the thrush sings to the coloured things,
 And earth forgets the night.

No otherwise wends on our Hope:
 E'en as a tale that's told
Are fair lives lost, and all the cost
 Of wise and true and bold.

We've toiled and failed; we spake the word;
 None hearkened; dumb we lie;
Our Hope is dead, the seed we spread
 Fell o'er the earth to die.

What's this? For joy our hearts stand still,
 And life is loved and dear,
The lost and found the Cause hath crowned,
 The Day of Days is here.
