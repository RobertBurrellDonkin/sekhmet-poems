Clashed sword on shield By William Morris

    Clashed sword on shield In the harvest field;
      And no man blames The red red flames,
    War's candle-wick On roof and rick.
      Now dead lies the yeoman unwept and unknown
    On the field he hath furrowed, the ridge he hath sown:
      And all in the middle of wethers and neat
    The maidens are driven with blood on their feet;
      For yet 'twixt the Burg-gate and battle half-won
    The dust-driven highway creeps uphill and on,
      And the smoke of the beacons goes coiling aloft,
    While the gathering horn bloweth loud, louder and oft.

    Throw wide the gates
      For nought night waits;
    Though the chase is dead
      The moon's o'erhead
    And we need the clear
      Our spoil to share.
    Shake the lots in the helm then for brethren are we,
      And the goods of my missing are gainful to thee.
    Lo! thine are the wethers, and his are the kine;
      And the colts of the marshland unbroken are thine,
    With the dapple-grey stallion that trampled his groom;
      And Giles hath the gold-blossomed rose of the loom.
    Lo! leaps out the last lot and nought have I won,
      But the maiden unmerry, by battle undone.
