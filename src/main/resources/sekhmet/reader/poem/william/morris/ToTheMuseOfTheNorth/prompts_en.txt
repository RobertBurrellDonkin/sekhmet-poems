To The Muse Of The North By William Morris


O muse that swayest the sad Northern Song,
 Thy right hand full of smiting and of wrong,
Thy left hand holding pity; and thy breast
 Heaving with hope of that so certain rest:
Thou, with the grey eyes kind and unafraid,
 The soft lips trembling not, though they have said
The doom of the World and those that dwell therein.
 The lips that smile not though thy children win
The fated Love that draws the fated Death.
 O, borne adown the fresh stream of thy breath,
Let some word reach my ears and touch my heart,
 That, if it may be, I may have a part
In that great sorrow of thy children dead
 That vexed the brow, and bowed adown the head,
Whitened the hair, made life a wondrous dream,
 And death the murmur of a restful stream,
But left no stain upon those souls of thine
 Whose greatness through the tangled world doth shine.
O Mother, and Love and Sister all in one,
 Come thou; for sure I am enough alone
That thou thine arms about my heart shouldst throw,
 And wrap me in the grief of long ago.
