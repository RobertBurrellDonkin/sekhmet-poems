The Sheriff is made a mighty lord By William Morris

        The Sheriff is made a mighty lord,
            Of goodly gold he hath enow,
        And many a sergeant girt with sword;
            But forth will we and bend the bow.
                We shall bend the bow on the lily lea
                Betwixt the thorn and the oaken tree.

        With stone and lime is the burg wall built,
            And pit and prison are stark and strong,
        And many a true man there is spilt,
            And many a right man doomed by wrong.
            	So forth shall we and bend the bow
                And the king's writ never the road shall know.

        Now yeomen walk ye warily,
            And heed ye the houses where ye go,
        For as fair and as fine as they may be,
            Lest behind your heels the door clap to.
                Fare forth with the bow to the lily lea
                Betwixt the thorn and the oaken tree.

        Now bills and bows I and out a-gate!
            And turn about on the lily lea!
        And though their company be great
            The grey-goose wing shall set us free.
                Now bent is the bow in the green abode
                And the king's writ knoweth not the road.

        So over the mead and over the hithe,
            And away to the wild-wood wend we forth;
        There dwell we yeomen bold and blithe
            Where the Sheriff's word is nought of worth.
                Bent is the bow on the lily lea
                Betwixt the thorn and the oaken tree.
