  In Time of Pestilence, 1593 by Thomas Nashe,

  by Robert Burrell Donkin of Yorkshire, England.


ADIEU, farewell earth's bliss!
 This world uncertain is:
Fond are life's lustful joys,
 Death proves them all but toys.
None from his darts can fly;
 I am sick, I must die-
Lord, have mercy on us!

Rich men, trust not in wealth,
 Gold cannot buy you health;
Physic himself must fade;
 All things to end are made;
The plague full swift goes by;
 I am sick, I must die-
Lord, have mercy on us!

Beauty is but a flower
 Which wrinkles will devour;
Brightness falls from the air;
 Queens have died young and fair;
Dust hath closed Helen's eye;
 I am sick, I must die-
Lord, have mercy on us!

Strength stoops unto the grave,
 Worms feed on Hector brave;
Swords may not fight with fate;
 Earth still holds ope her gate;
Come, come! the bells do cry;
 I am sick, I must die-
Lord, have mercy on us!

Wit with his wantonness
 Tasteth death's bitterness;
Hell's executioner
 Hath no ears for to hear
What vain art can reply;
 I am sick, I must die-
Lord, have mercy on us!

Haste therefore each degree
 To welcome destiny;
Heaven is our heritage,
 Earth but a player's stage.
Mount we unto the sky;
 I am sick, I must die-
Lord, have mercy on us!
